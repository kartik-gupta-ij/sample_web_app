## Web Components

Web Components are a set of browser standards that enable the creation of reusable UI elements that can be easily shared and composed to build complex web apps. A web component is essentially a bundle of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that encapsulates a particular piece of functionality or UI element. 

Web Components consist of three main technologies:

1. Custom Elements: Custom Elements allow developers to create their own custom HTML tags, which can then be used throughout the app just like any other HTML tag. Custom Elements can have properties, methods, and events, making them highly modular and reusable.

2. Shadow DOM: Shadow DOM allows developers to encapsulate the styling and behavior of a web component within its own boundary, so that it doesn't interfere with the rest of the app's styling and behavior. Shadow DOM is particularly useful for creating UI elements that require a lot of styling and interactivity.

3. HTML Templates: HTML Templates allow developers to define chunks of HTML that can be used as a blueprint for creating multiple instances of a web component. This makes it easy to reuse the same UI element in different parts of the app.

Together, these three technologies allow developers to create modular, reusable, and easy-to-maintain UI elements that can be composed to build complex web apps.

## Creating a Simple Web App with Web Components and Bootstrap

Here's a step-by-step guide to creating a simple web app using Web Components and Bootstrap:

1. Create a new HTML file and add the necessary tags to define the document structure.
2. Create a new JavaScript file and define the web components you want to use in your app. For each component, define the template, the properties, and the methods you want to expose to the outside world
3. Import the web components into your main JavaScript file and add them to the DOM.
